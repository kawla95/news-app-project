You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment.

Below are the names of the databases you will need when making a successful connection locally:

News DB:
PGDATABASE=nc_news

News Test DB:
PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
